when you require a file, there are multiple places where node will look for that file.

ø: Core modules, e.g. fs, http. Just name it, no path required.
ø: installed modules, e.g. underscore, request. Just name it, no path required.
ø: Other javascript files, e.g. models, or controllers. Relative file path. 

My typical controller scheme:
renderViews
handleForms
api

this always defined.
